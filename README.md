## Motivation

This browser **—still without a name or icon—** is just a fun side project to sharpen my Swift and SwiftUI skills. It’s highly experimental and unstable, so it’s not meant for real use.
## Technologies

- _SwiftUI_: Powers the app's entire user interface.
- _SwiftData_: Persists data such as Spaces and Tabs.
- _WebKit_: The Browser's Engine.

## Building

The project now links against the system-provided WebKit, so a custom WebKit.framework checkout is no longer required. Open `Browser.xcodeproj` and build the `Browser` scheme with the latest Xcode on macOS.
